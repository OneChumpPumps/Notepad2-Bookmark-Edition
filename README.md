Notepad2 Bookmark Edition
=========================

Notepad2 is a light-weight, free and open source Notepad-like text editor with syntax highlighting, originally created by [Florian Balmer](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html). *Bookmark Edition* is a port with extra features. Windows binaries are available from my [homepage](http://rlvision.com/notepad2/about.asp)

## Bookmark Edition Features

* Bookmark lines with Ctrl+F2 and jump between bookmarks with F2
* Added wildcard search to Find/Replace dialogs
* Added help buttons to the Find/Replace dialogs with quick syntax references
* Assigned F12 hotkey for 'Save as'
* Number of selected lines is displayed in the statusbar
* Tweaked 'Convert to Title Case' (based on my experience with [Flash Renamer](http://rlvision.com/flashren/))
* Find/Replace dialog will automatically be filled with clipboard content first time used
* See readme for a more detailed look at the changes
